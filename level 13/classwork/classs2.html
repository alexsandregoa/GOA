    <h1>Daemon:
The only way to survive in the dark is to become it.
I cant even remember what its like to feel anything but vengeance.
But everything changes when my mother marries the leader of our bitter enemies.
Play nice was the request. Not a chance.
And in exchange, I get the honor of breaking his only daughter.
They think were in this fight together. Theyre wrong.
Were here to tear them apart. One by one.
And were starting with her. Little does she know, she wont survive the love she seeks.
Im not her savior. Im death at her door.
Naughty little thing has no clue just how deep Im going to take her before I destroy everything she holds dear.
And theres one person thats going to help me do it—her.</h1>
